# FIXME(jeff): I do not believe that this crond daemon has
# support compiled in for sending emails -- cronic does
# indeed work proper, but it is the job of the crond daemon
# to do the actual legwork here. Further research is 
# warranted [1]...

#
# CONFIRMED(jeff): We must build a Busybox package that has
# sendmail enabled in order for the Busybox implementation
# of cron to send mail for us. While we are at it, if we 
# wind up doing so, we ought to also compile in the 
# run-parts applet. The BASH version we are using is not 
# 100% compatible with ash.

# FIXME(jeff): Eek! run-parts broke my cron jobs. I will put either porting
# or re-writing a replacement for run-parts in the coming weeks...
